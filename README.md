## How to Execute:

* Pull down the code from our github repo: [Github Repo](https://github.com/jbradensmile/OrionApplitoolsHackAThon2020) 

* In your favorite IDE, that supports python, open to the root project folder.

* From the root, in your terminal, execute the command: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

* Once all of the requirements have been satisfied, navigate to the folder you wish to execute from. 

* Once in the folder you wish to execute from, in your terminal, execute the command: `python [name of file]` + tab.

    > Example:
        > `python test_task_1` + tab

* Project will execute and you'll see print messages in your terminal, walking you through where the project is in the code.

* After execution has completed, open a browser and navigate to our dashboard: [Applitools Dashboard](https://eyes.applitools.com/app/test-results/00000251809282545941/?accountId=t9ya4p0qdkSRp3-7IdlaGA~~).
